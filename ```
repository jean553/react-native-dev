## Run your app with Expo

1. Install Expo Go on your mobile device:
   - [Android Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
   - [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)

2. Open Expo Go on your device and tap on "Scan QR code".

3. Scan the QR code displayed in your terminal or in the Expo Developer Tools.

Your app should now load on your device.

## Monitoring / Debugging

Open `http://localhost:19002` in your browser to access the Expo Developer Tools interface. This provides various options for monitoring and debugging your app.

## Using it with Vagrant

The provided Vagrantfile includes configurations for port forwarding and setting up the development environment. Here are some key points:

- Port 19000, 19001, and 19002 are forwarded from the guest to the host.
- The container uses the `jean553/react-native-dev` Docker image.
- The `REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME` is automatically set to your local IP address.

## Additional Tips

- To add dependencies to your project, use `yarn add` or `npm install` within the project directory.
- The development environment includes Zsh with Oh My Zsh for an enhanced command-line experience.
- Vim is pre-configured with some basic settings for easier coding.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the setup or running your React Native app, please check the following:

1. Ensure all prerequisites are installed and up to date.
2. Verify that the required ports (19000, 19001, 19002) are not being used by other applications.
3. If you're having network issues, make sure your mobile device and development machine are on the same Wi-Fi network.
